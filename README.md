# PACMAN's Maze

This is a pure web maze game with [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) integrated.
The player can use Blockly to write a simple control program to help PACMAN gets out of the maze.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Now open a browser and visit `localhost:8080`.

To generate javascript files: `npm run-script build` and run an HTTP server using files from `dist` directory.
